    \begin{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Good, bad, ugly}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item This paper is about handwriting recognition
        \item This paper uses CNN to recognize handwriting
        \item This paper studies if dropout improves handwriting recognition with Lenet-5
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Great}:
    
    \begin{quote}
        This paper studies if randomly masking certain coefficients during training (dropout) can prevent Lenet-5 from overfitting, and thus improves handwriting recognition task performance on MNIST dataset.

        \item \textbf{The Reverse Triangle}
        \item \textbf{Steps}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Survey the field to understand the broader context.
            \item Identify key debates and research gaps.
            \item How your research contributes to the field by closing the gap

    \frametitle{Example}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Handwriting recognition is a longstanding problem in the field of computer vision ...
        \item The Lenet-5 model (LeCun et al., 1998) significantly improved the performances by using CNN to automatically learning features from raw images.
        \item However, research (So and so, 200x; So and so,200y) shows that CNN is prone to overfitting. Recently Hinton et al. (2014) proposed a new method called dropout that randomly masks certain coefficients during training.
        \item This paper attempts to apply dropout to improve the performance of Lenet-5 model in handwriting recognition

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Prefer tables over graphs. Prefer simplicity over complexity.

    \frametitle{How to Interpret}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item SRU-G is translate-invariant while has comparable performance to the SOTA model other scenarios
        \item Graph X demonstrates that the SRU-G is translate-invariant while has comparable performance to the Resnet-16(SOTA) in other scenarios.
        The SRU-G achieves 89\% accuracy on the translate dataset, outperforming the SOTA Resnet-16 by 16\%, while trailing the SOTA model in other scenarios by a narrow margin of 1.5\% on average.
        The SRU-G outperforms the baseline models that motivates the research. The baseline SRU model is the weakest model in the raw dataset and is suspectible to noise, especially the translation noise. The Resnet-4 has similar depth as the SRU-G but its accuracy is on average 15\% lower than the SRU-G.
        The experiment data show that the shallow SRU-G is robust to translation and has a competitive overall performance to the SOTA model.
